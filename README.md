## Installation & Running the Game

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (for running the local server)
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)

---

### Using the Node.js Server

This option is ideal if you want to run the game on a local server.

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mario-8-bit.git
    cd mario-8-bit
    ```

2. **Install the Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Start the Server:**

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    By default, the server listens on port **3000** (or another port if specified in your `server.js`). You should see a message in the terminal such as:

    ```
    Game running at http://localhost:3000
    ```

4. **Open the Game in Your Browser:**

    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your web browser.

---

### Running Locally Without a Server

If you prefer to run the game without setting up a Node server, you can:

1. Simply open the `index.html` file in your favorite web browser.
2. Note that certain features (like live-reloading or logging) might be limited when running as a static file.

---

## Development

If you'd like to modify or enhance the game, here are the main files you'll work with:

- **`index.html`**  
  Contains the layout for the game. It now includes a stylish title and score display.

- **`game.js`**  
  Holds all the game logic, such as drawing the player/enemies, handling collisions, and updating the game state.

- **`server.js`**  
  A simple Express.js server used to serve the game during development. You can modify the port or add extra middleware if needed.

- **`README.md`**  
  This file, which contains complete instructions and details about the project.

After editing your code, simply refresh the page in your browser (or restart the server) to see changes.
